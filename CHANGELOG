0.0.10
======

- Add a MANIFEST.in file to include version, changelog, docs, etc. in the
  uuiduser package.


0.0.9
=====

- Revert 0.0.8.  This needs more thought.


0.0.8
=====

- Don't fail when alternative backends that don't use username are used.

  When using a different auth backend (oauth for example) the username is set
  to `None`.  This, in combination with the istant signup (where users don't
  have a username) was leading to `MultipleObjectsReturned` from the
  `User.objects.get(username__iexact=username)` query.

  Now we just fail if we can't resolve a username, and pass on the
  authentication duties to the next backend.


0.0.7
=====

- Make it less weird to subclass DefaultUserManager.


0.0.6
=====

- Address Django 1.9 warnings about custom fields
- Create DefaultUserManager in the UUIDUser class instead of at the module
  level.
- Make setup.py compatible with standard UNB Python package layout.
- Add CHANGELOG
- Add VERSION



< 0.0.6
